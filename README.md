# IFT
This is the repository for the W3C [Incremental Font Transfer specification](https://w3c.github.io/IFT/Overview.html), developed by the [W3C Web Fonts working group](https://www.w3.org/Fonts/WG/).

There is [an Explainer](https://github.com/w3c/IFT/blob/main/IFT-Explainer.md).

The pre-standardization [simulation work](https://github.com/w3c/PFE-analysis) which informs this specification is summarized and explained in an [Evaluation Report](https://www.w3.org/TR/PFE-evaluation/). 

The previous work on [WOFF and WOFF 2.0 File Formats](https://github.com/w3c/woff) is also available.
